                        <ul>
                            <p>Hello! My name is Caleb Early and I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math at Bridgewater College.</p>
                            <p>When I was young, around middle school age, my cousin used to teach me 3D modeling, but I was never very good at it. In response to this I dabbled in different hobbies trying to find something that I could be better than him at, until I stumbled across coding.</p>
                            <p>At the start I wasn't really that good, but I realized how fun it was and started to spend almost all my time trying to figure out how to make games.</p>
                            <p>It's been 8.5 years now since I first started, and I haven't regretted the journey even for a second.</p>
                            <p>Coding is my dream, passion, hobby, and life and if I'm ever at my computer there's a good chance that I'll be working on something.</p>
                            <p>My main fascination is combining math with programming to see what I can create, but I love to push the boundaries of what JavaScript in the web browser can do.</p>
