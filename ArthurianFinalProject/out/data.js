This could be seen as an attempt to broaden the audience to a genre not everyone is interested in and to other audiences who aren’t just Christian. Another reason for connecting it with the Christmas holiday could be to appeal to younger audiences because what child doesn’t like Christmas? Other religious symbolism could include having Christmas be a symbol to being gifted forgiveness from God that the people then should go out and share with the world, and then with Excalibur being like a gift to Arthur that he should not just keep for himself but do great things for the world with.`

In Chrétien and Malory, most of the knights were Christian and would commend each other to God but in Tennyson this didn’t happen nearly as much, and Christianity did not feel as if it was tangled throughout the reality these characters were living in. In T.H. White’s Sword in the Stone there is almost no religious aspect even though the legendary sword Excalibur sits in front of a church and appears to be an item from God with unworldly powers as no one can pull it out or know where it came from. The film i[Excalibur] doesn’t have much religious aspect either, but King Arthur 2004 does have some with Arthur himself being the outsider and the one who is Christian with Lancelot questioning him about this because none of the other knights are Christian. This change creates an interesting dynamic by having the audience further separate Arthur from the rest of his knights by giving him this trait. The rest of the film puts Arthur high above the other knights which may be an extension of the canonical idea that being Christian, and a good king go together.`

Fate has played a large role in Arthurian legend and seems to be a consistent theme among the medieval and the modern but with more of a sense of “choice” in the modern. If we relate this to nature versus nurture, in Malory there is much more emphasis on nature as knights seem to be pre-destined to being good knights like with the examples of Sir Tor and Sir Percival. No matter how strong Arthur or his knights are (Lancelot is the best knight in the world, Galahad is the purest knight in the world, and there are many other honorable mentions like Arthur himself, Tristram, Gawain) but still everything crashes down because of nothing to do with strength but with love which triumphs in Malory, Tennyson, and is the one “unsuccessful” interaction in Disney’s Sword in the Stone. This could be seen as a balance between love and power, and Arthur had his reign and now history must even itself out again, there can’t be too much of one good thing and things must even out, so for something great to happen (Arthur’s reign), a downfall of equal significance had to follow.`

In the Disney movie this idea of Wart being an “underdog” and naive is emphasized even further with his scrawny character compared to the masculine brutes that Kay and Ector are. For the common boy reading or hearing these stories it may have been more likely that someone may relate and sympathize with Wart’s character rather than Kay’s.
